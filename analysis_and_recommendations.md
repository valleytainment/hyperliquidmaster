3. Provide clear guidelines on appropriate leverage levels based on experience
4. Explain the psychological aspects of trading and how to maintain discipline

## Technical Implementation Notes

1. **Risk Management Module**:
   ```python
   def calculate_position_size(account_equity, risk_percentage, entry_price, stop_loss_price, volatility_factor=None):
       """
       Calculate position size based on account equity, risk percentage, and stop loss distance.
       Optionally adjust for volatility using ATR.
       
       Args:
           account_equity: Total account equity
           risk_percentage: Maximum risk per trade (e.g., 1%)
           entry_price: Planned entry price
           stop_loss_price: Planned stop loss price
           volatility_factor: Optional ATR or other volatility measure
           
       Returns:
           Appropriate position size in contracts/coins
       """
       risk_amount = account_equity * (risk_percentage / 100)
       price_distance = abs(entry_price - stop_loss_price)
       
       # Adjust for volatility if provided
       if volatility_factor:
           # Reduce position size for higher volatility
           adjusted_distance = price_distance * (1 + (volatility_factor / entry_price))
           position_size = risk_amount / adjusted_distance
       else:
           position_size = risk_amount / price_distance
           
       return position_size
   ```

2. **Liquidation Warning System**:
   ```python
   def calculate_liquidation_proximity(current_price, liquidation_price, warning_threshold=0.15):
       """
       Calculate proximity to liquidation and provide appropriate warnings.
       
       Args:
           current_price: Current market price
           liquidation_price: Calculated liquidation price
           warning_threshold: Percentage distance that triggers warning (e.g., 15%)
           
       Returns:
           Warning level and message
       """
       distance_percentage = abs(current_price - liquidation_price) / current_price * 100
       
       if distance_percentage <= warning_threshold * 0.5:
           return "CRITICAL", f"EXTREME RISK: Only {distance_percentage:.2f}% from liquidation!"
       elif distance_percentage <= warning_threshold:
           return "WARNING", f"HIGH RISK: {distance_percentage:.2f}% from liquidation"
       else:
           return "SAFE", f"Position {distance_percentage:.2f}% from liquidation"
   ```

3. **Scale Order Implementation**:
   ```python
   def create_scale_orders(symbol, is_buy, total_size, price_range, num_orders):
       """
       Create multiple limit orders distributed across a price range.
       
       Args:
           symbol: Trading pair symbol
           is_buy: True for buy orders, False for sell orders
           total_size: Total position size to be distributed
           price_range: Tuple of (start_price, end_price)
           num_orders: Number of orders to create
           
       Returns:
           List of order details
       """
       start_price, end_price = price_range
       price_step = (end_price - start_price) / (num_orders - 1)
       size_per_order = total_size / num_orders
       
       orders = []
       for i in range(num_orders):
           price = start_price + (i * price_step)
           orders.append({
               "symbol": symbol,
               "is_buy": is_buy,
               "size": size_per_order,
               "price": price
           })
           
       return orders
   ```

## Conclusion

Incorporating these elements from the expert content will significantly enhance the HyperliquidMaster bot's capabilities, particularly in risk management and position sizing. The most critical improvements focus on capital preservation and psychological safeguards, which align with the expert content's emphasis that no strategy can achieve 100% success, making risk management paramount.

These enhancements will provide users with a more robust, safer trading system that can operate effectively in various market conditions while protecting capital from excessive drawdowns.
